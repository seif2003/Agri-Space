Agri Space is a comprehensive platform designed to assist users in various aspects of agriculture. It combines three main functionalities:

1. Weather Forecasting: Provides real-time weather updates based on the user's location. This feature helps users plan their agricultural activities more effectively.

2. Marketplace: A dedicated space for users to post and view classified ads related to agriculture. This feature facilitates the buying and selling of agricultural products and equipment.

3. Plant Disease Recognition: An AI-powered feature that recognizes plant diseases. Users can submit an image of their plant, and the AI will analyze it to identify any potential diseases.
